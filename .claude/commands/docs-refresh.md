# Docs Refresh

Update project documentation to reflect current codebase state.

## Phase 1: Discovery

1. **Read CLAUDE.md** — understand current architecture, patterns, conventions
2. **Find all documentation** — README.md, docs/, any .md files in the repository
3. **Analyze codebase** — structure, key files, recent changes

## Phase 2: Audit

Compare documentation against actual code:
- Outdated descriptions?
- Undocumented features?
- References to deleted code?
- New patterns worth documenting?

## Phase 3: Update

Update discovered documentation:

**CLAUDE.md** — for Claude:
- Architecture and code structure
- Key files and their purpose
- Patterns and conventions
- Important commands

**README.md** — for humans:
- What the project does
- How to install/run
- Main features

**Other docs** — as needed

## Guidelines

- No fluff
- Remove outdated content
- Don't rewrite unchanged sections
- Preserve existing style

## Report

At the end:
- What was updated
- What was removed
- What stayed unchanged
